 <p class="para3">A barracuda is a large, predatory ray-finned fish known for its fearsome appearance and ferocious behaviour.
   The barracuda is a saltwater fish of the genus Sphyraena, the only genus in the family Sphyraenidae which was named by Constantine 
   Samuel Rafinesque in 1815.[2] It is found in tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide ranging from the eastern border of the Atlantic
   Ocean to the Red Sea, on its western border the Caribbean Sea, and in tropical areas of the Pacific Ocean. Barracudas reside near the 
   top of the water and near coral reefs and sea grasses.[3]
   <p class="para4">Barracuda are snake-like in appearance, with prominent, sharp-edged, fang-like teeth, much like piranha, all of different 
     sizes, set in sockets of their large jaws. They have large, pointed heads with an underbite in many species. Their gill covers have no 
     spines and are covered with small scales.
